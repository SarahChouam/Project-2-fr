discription
1. Introduction

The purpose of this report is to explain the design and functionality of a Python script that ranks hurricanes based on their names, intensity levels (category), and locations. The script aims to provide an efficient way of organizing and displaying hurricane data for users, helping them understand the severity and geographical distribution of various hurricanes.

2. System Design

2.1 Data Structure
The core data structure used to store hurricane information is a list of dictionaries (or objects in this case). Each hurricane is represented as an instance of the Hurricane class, which contains the following attributes:

Name: The name of the hurricane (e.g., "Katrina", "Irma").
Level: The intensity category of the hurricane, which is usually ranked from 1 to 5 (Category 1 being the least severe and Category 5 being the most severe).
Location: The geographical location or region affected by the hurricane (e.g., "Caribbean Sea", "Texas").
The Hurricane class is designed with an __init__ method that initializes these attributes, and a __repr__ method that defines how each hurricane object is displayed when printed.

2.2 Functionality
The main function of the script is the rank_hurricanes function, which is responsible for sorting the hurricanes based on their intensity and name. The function performs the following tasks:

Sorting by Intensity: The hurricanes are sorted primarily by their intensity level (Category). A descending order is used for sorting, where Category 5 hurricanes are ranked higher than Category 1 hurricanes.
Sorting by Name: If two or more hurricanes have the same intensity level, they are then sorted alphabetically by their name. This ensures that hurricanes of equal intensity are listed in a consistent and easy-to-read manner.
The hurricanes are then displayed in ranked order, with their respective category and location.

2.3 Sample Data
To demonstrate the functionality, the script uses a predefined list of hurricanes, each represented by a Hurricane object with a specific name, level, and location. Below is an example of the sample data used in the script:

Katrina: Category 5, Gulf of Mexico
Irma: Category 4, Caribbean Sea
Harvey: Category 4, Texas
Maria: Category 5, Caribbean Sea
Sandy: Category 3, East Coast US
3. Execution and Output

When executed, the script processes the list of hurricanes and ranks them according to the sorting criteria mentioned above. The result is displayed in the terminal, showing each hurricane’s rank, name, category, and location. Here is an example of the output generated by the script:

Copy code
Ranked Hurricanes:
1. Katrina (Category 5) - Gulf of Mexico
2. Maria (Category 5) - Caribbean Sea
3. Irma (Category 4) - Caribbean Sea
4. Harvey (Category 4) - Texas
5. Sandy (Category 3) - East Coast US
The hurricanes are ordered by their category, and in cases where two hurricanes share the same category, they are listed alphabetically by name.

4. Features and Customization

The script is designed to be simple and extensible. Below are some key features and potential customizations:

Dynamic Input: While the script uses hardcoded data for demonstration, it can be modified to take dynamic input from users or external data sources (e.g., CSV, JSON files). This could be useful for analyzing real-time hurricane data.
Additional Sorting Criteria: Users can modify the sorting logic to prioritize other factors, such as location or the date of the hurricane.
User Interface: For larger-scale applications, the script could be integrated with a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow users to input and view hurricane data more interactively.
Advanced Data Handling: The script can be enhanced to handle more complex hurricane data, including the exact dates, wind speed, and damage reports, by incorporating additional attributes into the Hurricane class.
5. Conclusion

This Python script serves as a foundational tool for ranking and displaying hurricane data based on severity and location. The simplicity of the design ensures it is easy to understand, modify, and extend. The ranking system provides a quick and effective way to assess the most severe hurricanes, and its flexibility allows for future enhancements.

In its current form, the script is a useful resource for researchers, meteorologists, or anyone interested in organizing and analyzing hurricane data. Future versions could be expanded to incorporate real-time data, integrate with databases, and provide more detailed analysis of each hurricane’s impact.
